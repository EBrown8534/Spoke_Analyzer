# Spoke Analyzer

This program allows one to analyze the overlaps of two shapes with given spoke counts and also allows for creation of an
animation to demonstrate the intersections.

The best way to describe this is with a sample:

[![A rotational diagram][1]][1]

For this particular image, we have two shapes:

1. **Red**: 8 spokes, fixed;
2. **Green**: 9 spokes, rotates;

We also have two properties we are concerned about:

1. **Overlap Angle Difference**: how many degrees between each intersection? (here it is 5°)
2. **Overlaps per Rotation**: in a 360° rotation, how many total intersections? (here it is 72)
